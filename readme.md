# Datapack Updater
The project aims to upgrade your commands from 1.20.4 to the newer version of Minecraft (1.20.5).

## Features
I'm still working on it.

## Get to start
### Use in command mode:
```bash
node index.js -c "<Your commands here>"
```
for example
```bash
node index.js -c "/give @s[distance=0..5] diamond_sword[enchantments={sharpness:1}]{Enchantments:[{id:\"sharpness\",lvl:1s}]}"
```
